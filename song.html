[Chorus]
I been living fast, fast, fast, fast
Feeling really bad, bad, bad, bad
Time really moves fast, fast, fast, fast
Better hurry up and get in your bag, bag, bag, bag
I wear Dior, not a fad, 'ad, ’ad, 'ad<br><br>
I know all these niggas gettin' mad, mad, mad, mad
My hand on my trigger, I’ma die for respect, yeah
Fucking with my money, you'll get dealt like that, yeah
<br><br>
[Verse 1]
I took too many pills, countin' up the bills, uh
Molly in my cup, I can't tell you how I feel, uh<br><br>
Oh, last call
Oh-oh, it's gnarly
Every day I be counting up, counting up the blues<br><br>
Gotta win sometimes when you always lose
I get high as a bitch, still the same dude
I was back then, but now I'm lost and confused

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain't see it coming
I ain't see it coming
But it still came
I’m talkin’ 'bout life, ayy (Talkin’ 'bout life)<br><br>
[Chorus]
I been living fast, fast, fast, fast
Feeling really bad, bad, bad, bad
Time really moves fast, fast, fast, fast
Better hurry up and get in your bag, bag, bag, bag
I wear Dior, not a fad, 'ad, 'ad, ’ad
I know all these niggas gettin' mad, mad, mad, mad<br><br>
My hand on my trigger, I'ma die for respect, yeah
Fucking with my money, you'll get dealt like that, yeah

[Verse 2]
I go through so much, I'm 19 years old
It's been months since I felt at home
But it's okay 'cause I'm rich, psych
I'm still sad as a bitch, right
I don't want nobody to think that I'm an asshole<br><br>
I don't try to be mean on purpose, I promise
My mama taught me better than that, I'll be honest
I blame it on the drugs and this life I'm involved in

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain't see it coming (I ain't see it)
I ain't see it coming (I ain't see it)
But it still came (Yeah, yeah, it still came)<br><br>
I'm talkin' 'bout life, ayy (Talkin' 'bout life)
[Chorus]
I been living fast, fast, fast, fast
Feeling really bad, bad, bad, bad
Time really moves fast, fast, fast, fast
Better hurry up and get in your bag, bag, bag, bag
I wear Dior, not a fad, 'ad, 'ad, 'ad
I know all these niggas gettin' mad, mad, mad, mad
My hand on my trigger, I'ma die for respect, yeah
Fucking with my money, you'll get dealt like that, yeah

[Bridge]
Elevate, elevate, elevate myself
Now I'm on the ground, on the ground, haven't been myself
But it's okay, it's cool, won't push the issue
What happens next? A story to be continued, yeah

[Chorus]
I been living fast, fast, fast, fast
Feeling really bad, bad, bad, bad
Time really moves fast, fast, fast, fast
Better hurry up and get in your bag, bag, bag, bag
I wear Dior, not a fad, 'ad, 'ad, 'ad
I know all these niggas gettin' mad, mad, mad, mad
My hand on my trigger, I'ma die for respect, yeah
Fucking with my money, you'll get dealt like that, yeah
[Outro]
This is fire, hahaha, yeah
This is fire
